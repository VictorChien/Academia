I had the great opportunity to lead an incoming group of students on The Juniper Project during my time in the BioProspecting Research Stream. Here is a brief introduction of the project.

Plants rely heavily on the microorganisms living within them to survive. Fungi that live symbiotically within plants, otherwise known as endophytic fungi, are crucial in maintaining homeostasis within plants by supplementing nutrient uptake and providing chemical defenses against plant pathogens. The precise biochemical pathways of these fungal endophytes may yield useful compounds.

This project utilizes *Juniperus ashei*, an evergreen tree with a profound ecological impact. While Juniper trees provide an ecosystem for a variety of species, one species of warbler is of particular interest since it nests exclusively on Juniper trees. With rot resistant bark, Juniper has been found to prevent Oak Wilt, a plant fungal disease. The Juniper tree has been used historically to alleviate pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

The purpose of this project is to elucidate a correlation between the properties of the Juniper tree and the properties of the endophytic fungi isolated from the bark and leaves of the tree. Samples were taken from an older site with warbler nesting and a younger site without warbler nesting. The fungi were grouped by morphology and compared between site, tissue type, and its interaction using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and a Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) test. The antifungal and antibacterial properties of the endophytic fungi were assayed alongside genetic characterization. The extraction of biomolecules from these fungi may help clarify the biochemical pathways involved, and the consequent mechanisms of action of these fungal endophytes.

The poster constructed in preparation for the 2019 Undergraduate Research Forum hosted at UT Austin won the Audience's Choice award.
