I decided to intern with UTeach Outreach and help teach computer science and enginnering to 9th and 10th graders the summer after my 2nd year at UT Austin. The 4-summer program focused on STEM education and aimed to serve underpriveliged kids from the Austin Independent School District. Although nearly half of them qualified for free/reduced-price lunch, all of them were unquestionably intelligent and have bright futures ahead of them.

This was a really cool experience for me since I had no prior teaching experience and I had only learned many of the coding concepts in the prior year. This gave me a chance to think about how I would explain concepts that require quite a bit of logical thinking. For loops, conditional statements, and functions are elementary concepts in any coding language, but if you've never used them before, it can be difficult to grasp. 

Computer science came naturally to some students; however, I distinctly remember a table of three students who weren't the biggest fans of the class. My initial thought was that they just didn't want to do their work, but after sitting down and talking with them, it became clear to me that they just didn't get it. I was ecstatic to hear that because it meant that they weren't just being rude and refusing to learn. It did, however, mean that they were becoming discouraged and close to giving up, but it was literally my job as content intern to make sure the students didn't fall behind. It was my time to shine! 

First, I reassured them by reiterating that this is difficult stuff, especially for students just barely in high school. Next, I backtracked to get an idea of what they did and didn't understand. At that point, it was a matter of rewording the purposes of basic functions like count(), for(), and function(); coming up with examples of how they can be used in a script; and asking them questions to make sure they understood. 

It was late in the day, but I sat with them for almost an hour as we worked through the coding modules together as a table group. I found it difficult to contain my excitement as their worried frowns turned to accomplished smiles. Learning how to teach was an incredibly useful skill, and it gave me a huge appreciation for all the educators I've come across in my lifetime as a student. 

It was a bit strange because the students were only a few years younger than me. I was in a similar situation when I worked with the High School Research Initiative (HRI), a collaboration between the Freshman Research Initiative and UTeach, which brought research to high schools in the Austin area. For HRI, I helped the science instructor at the Academy of Thought and Industry, a private high school with many students who had a difficult time in the public school system, teach the class how to work with fungi from the BioProspecting Lab and how to conduct scientific research.

I initially didn't feel very qualified to be teaching anything in either role, but I realized that the quality of these students' experiences was ultimately up to me and a handful of teachers/interns. So, I took matters into my own hands, started conducting myself with more confidence, and made sure each student got the attention they deserved.

Being a part of UTeach taught me how to be a part of a professional team. I was working with teachers from all sorts of academic and geographical backgrounds. To make sure everything ran smoothly, our small teams had to work together with everyone on the same page. I don't think I will soon forget such an inspirational team of educators and the many lessons I learned about teaching.
