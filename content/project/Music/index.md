I love music. And sure, that might be cliche but there's really nothing like it. I mean these sounds are essentially just vibrations in the air that our brains attribute meaning to. Some rhythms sound good to us and others don't. Moreover, many of us listen to all different kinds of genres that what sounds good to one person might sound completely unintelligible to another. 

I'm not sure what evolutionary purpose it might have served early humans to able to understand music and make it themselves, but music has certainly been an integral part of the human experience. Humans have been making music for millennia. Even a quick look back at the musical revolutions that happened nearly every decade from the 1940s on reveals the huge impact of music on contemporary society. Perhaps music was a cultural tool that facilitated humans' insatiable desire to socialize. But that's just my speculation. 

Whenever I have the opportunity to watch a performance, I marvel at the artist's sheer emotion. You know that feeling you get when you become super focused on something? Maybe you were writing something or painting a picture. Psychologists call it "Flow" and it's characterized by complete immersion in an activity. I'm sure you've seen it before - when the solo violinist plays moving her entire body with fervor, or when the jazz trumpeter gets lost in the improvisation, or when the singer closes his eyes and fills the room with rich vibrato and poetic lyrics. It's like enlightenment for musicians. It gives me chills just thinking about it.

Iâ€™ve been a part of band for 11 years, 8 of which were spent in marching band. I dedicated my high school marching band experience to doing color guard. Once I got into the Longhorn Band, I spent time polishing my knowledge on flute and piccolo before switching over to trumpet. I also decided to take private lessons on trombone and group lessons on guitar through UT. Each musical experience was meaningful and worthwhile in its own regard and I gained a deeper understanding of the musical world. I also got to meet all kinds of people who like all sorts of music. I think it's important to acknowledge the breadth of different music around the world and appreciate our diversity. It's what makes this art form so special.
