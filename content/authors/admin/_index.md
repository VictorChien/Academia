Currently, I'm a Neuroscience student at the University of Texas at Austin. I've been extraordinarily fortunate enough to learn from all the remarkable people on campus and be able to explore the weird culture of Austin. I am a scholar, a philosopher, and a scientist at heart. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me expanding my musical repertoire, engaging in meaningful conversation with friends over coffee, or just exploring the city and taking in the scenery.

You may be thinking, "Why *Neuroscience*?" I'm glad you asked! From an early age, I've relied on the sciences to help explain the world around me, from the molecular to the astronomical. The experience of life on Earth as it hurls through the galaxy is a surrealist's daydream. Throughout history, humans' perceptions of the world and of the self have undergone countless ideological shifts. With recent advancements in neuropsychology, neurobiology, and medicine, I see neuroscience as the gateway to understanding who we are.
