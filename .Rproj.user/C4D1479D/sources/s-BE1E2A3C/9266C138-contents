During the summer following the start of the pandemic, an unsteady economy left millions without access to foodstuffs. In an effort to provide some small amount of help, my roommates and I decided to volunteer with the Central Texas Food Bank. In a socially distant manner, we helped load up cars with packages of fresh produce, canned goods, and frozen meats, and dairy at drive-thru mobile food pantries. We also helped inspect, sanitize, and pack donated food at the CTFB warehouse. Food banks across the nation are in need of more volunteers to meet demand. If youâ€™re interested in helping out, visit the CTFB website at https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/.
